Job description
---------------

The *Concrete Lib* team is writing and maintaining the open-source cryptographic library of the same name. This library is used as the backbone of the whole *Concrete* Framework. It implements various cryptographic primitives and exposes them through different APIs targeting users from crypto neophytes to compiler writers. The codebase uses the Rust programming language as its main language, but it is expected to host hardware-specific code written in other languages in the near future.

As a secure computation library, `concrete-lib` is subject to high expectations in terms of safety and performance. The operators exposed by the library must be correctly implemented, reduce the attack surface, and prevent misuse by our users, all while still retaining the best performances possible. The Rust programming language is a perfect fit for this situation, and so far it has held its promise of being a fast and safe language.

To match our growing number of researchers inventing new operators, and users looking to harness the power of our library, we are looking for a new Rust Engineer to join our team and work on the `concrete-lib` project.

You and your team will be in charge of:

-   implementing cryptographic algorithms with the help of researchers at Zama
-   making the library fast, reliable, and polished
-   designing efficient and user-friendly APIs
-   improving the performance of the library with hardware or software optimizations
-   benchmarking and testing of the various cryptographic operations
-   ensuring the quality of the library delivery with continuous integration
-   providing support to users by answering github issues and forum topics

Preferred experience
--------------------

He / She / They should:

-   have between 2 and 7 years of experience
-   have experience with at least one of: Rust/Ocaml/Haskell/Scala/C++/C
-   have a strong interest and willingness to learn Rust
-   be into open source
-   be interested in cryptography
-   have good communication skills
-   full remote is possible, with with a willingness to visit Paris at least quarterly
