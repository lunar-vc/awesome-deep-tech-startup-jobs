# Researcher - Homomorphic Encryption

#### Zama's Product Portfolio

Zama stack is growing: We started with Concrete, a cryptographic library made for researchers and cryptographers, allowing fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) operations, and in early 2022, we will release the Concrete Framework, which is a set of tools on top of Concrete, including a compiler, to allow users to transform automatically and as easily as possible some numpy programs into FHE equivalents. The Concrete Framework is made for data scientists who may have no prior knowledge in cryptography.

To go further, Zama is starting a new product and a new division around machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). The goal is to automatically compile user models from their prefered classical ML framework (like tensorflow, torch, or scikit-learn). In addition, we'll provide a ready available architecture set made for FHE computations and ready for training.

#### Easy to use and effective tools

With our tools, users can easily develop ML and DL models, which can be used in a context where user privacy is ensured end-to-end, even if executed on an insecure server. The goal of our tools is to be as easy and user friendly as possible, while reducing the accuracy of networks as little as possible. Importantly, we want to not require the user to understand anything about cryptography, or, said in another way, we want to provide tools which look similar to what data scientists are already using.

#### Working in the team

Work in our team is a clever mix between research and product: on one side, we need to deeply understand and even make the research progress in some of the advanced machine learning topics, in order to be able to both have FHE-friendly products and excellent accuracy; on the other side, we need to have a clean, strong, and updatable product suite, notably due to Zama's open-source policy and willingness to accept external contributions.

We are looking for several engineers to help us to build and maintain this ML tool. We have constraints such as clarity of code, maintainability, and efficiency. We put a great emphasis in our tests and our different linters to ensure the highest possible quality. As we want to propose tools which look as similar as possible to what data scientists use regularly, most of our code is in python. Ideally, the engineer would also be interested in the research side of the company, and thus, participate in the research effort, for example, by writing papers, blog posts, and contributing to conferences and workshops. Experience with ML frameworks would be highly appreciated. Understanding of cryptography is a plus, but not required.

Your team (and thus you) will be responsible for:

-   coding, maintaining, testing, documenting the product
-   helping for the support of our users (internal and external)
-   help researchers to turn their prototyping ideas into production-quality code
-   patenting
-   diffusing the knowledge to the rest of the engineering team, and to Zama's users in the form of blogs, tutorials, and/or seminars and conferences
