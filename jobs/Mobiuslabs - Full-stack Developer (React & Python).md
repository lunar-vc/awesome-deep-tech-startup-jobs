# Full-stack Developer (React & Python)


Why become a "Mobian"?

AI is the future, and we are going to be a big part of that. Mobius Labs is a deep tech company that builds machine learning software to power applications for global enterprises. Our product adds value to millions of people but is built by a select few highly talented individuals. These Mobians form the heart and core of our organization. Based in Berlin, we currently have 40 people coming from 25 nationalities and are expanding rapidly.

The Mobius Vision‚Ñ¢ SDK is our cutting-edge platform to deploy and train advanced machine-learning models for imagery, video, face recognition, and more - all in a low-code, on-premise solution you can use with any programming language. The Feature Showcase is a no-code add-on to train, deploy and run machine learning models - by anyone who can use a mouse. We love it so much we also use it as our product demo - check it out!

What you would do as Full-Stack Developer:

As a Full-stack Developer, you will work with other engineers as well as our scientists and our product team to make Superhuman Vision available to everyone - developers and lay users alike. This is primarily a backend position, although from time to time we expect it will be necessary to help our front-end team with features, demos, or proofs-of-concept.

Adding new ML training, prediction, and data processing pipelines to our flexible one-premise SDK.
Helping us make our SDK faster, more scalable, and feature-rich as we take AI for everyone to new markets.
Creating next-generation web interfaces to showcase innovative Superhuman Vision‚Ñ¢ features for clients and customers (check it out!).
Developing internal tooling to help our product, delivery, and support, marketing, and science teams deliver value even faster.
Requirements
At least 5 years experience as a full-stack or backend software engineer working on complex applications with substantial business logic.

Frontend experience with React, ideally also Redux, Redux Saga, and MaterialUI.
Experience using Docker to build and deploy complex applications.
Strong skills of fundamental technologies (HTTP, REST/gRPC, HTML/CSS/JSON, web server configuration).
Experience with cloud platforms (GCP/AWS/Azure) as a deployment target.
Knowledge of SQL (Postgres) and NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB) databases.
Experience with automated deployments and continuous integration.
Feeling at home in Linux.
Fluency in English.
