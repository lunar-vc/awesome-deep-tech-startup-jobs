# Researcher - Machine Learning over Encrypted Data


#### Zama's Product Portfolio

Zama stack is growing: We started with Concrete, a cryptographic library made for researchers and cryptographers, allowing fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) operations, and in early 2022, we will release the Concrete Framework, which is a set of tools on top of Concrete, including a compiler, to allow users to transform automatically and as easily as possible some numpy programs into FHE equivalents. The Concrete Framework is made for data scientists who may have no prior knowledge in cryptography.

To go further, Zama is starting a new product and a new division around machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). The goal is to automatically compile user models from their prefered classical ML framework (like tensorflow, torch, or scikit-learn). In addition, we'll provide a ready available architecture set made for FHE computations and ready for training.

#### Easy to use and effective tools

With our tools, users can easily develop ML and DL models, which can be used in a context where user privacy is ensured end-to-end, even if executed on an insecure server. The goal of our tools is to be as easy and user friendly as possible, while reducing the accuracy of networks as little as possible. Importantly, we want to not require the user to understand anything about cryptography, or, said in another way, we want to provide tools which look similar to what data scientists are already using.

#### Working in the team

Work in our team is a clever mix between research and product: on one side, we need to deeply understand and even make the research progress in some of the advanced machine learning topics, in order to be able to both have FHE-friendly products and excellent accuracy; on the other side, we need to have a clean, strong, and updatable product suite, notably due to Zama's open-source policy and willingness to accept external contributions.

We are looking for several researchers in ML, ideally with knowledge and experience in quantized / discretized / binary networks, or at least with the will and interest to work on these subjects. Notably, the position will include publishing, promoting our techniques, patenting, and prototyping. Ideally, the researcher would also be interested in the engineering side of the company, and thus, participate to the development effort. Experience with ML frameworks would be highly appreciated. Understanding of cryptography is a plus, but not required.

Your team (and thus you) will be responsible for:

-   using/understanding/creating the best techniques to train/modify neural networks which are FHE-friendly
-   prototyping ideas (and ideally developing the product with the rest of the engineering teams)
-   publishing papers in research conferences
-   patenting
-   diffusing the knowledge to the rest of the engineering team, and to Zama's users in the form of blogs, tutorials, and/or seminars and conferences

Preferred experience
--------------------

-   be passionate about privacy and open source
-   experience in ML research (ideally with a Ph.D.), and ideally in discretization / quantization / binary neural networks
-   experience in post-training quantization and quantization aware training
-   experience in ML frameworks
-   optionally: development of prototypes / production tools in python
-   optionally: experience with FHE or cryptography
