# FPGA Engineer

You and your team will be responsible for:

-   implementing state-of-the-art algorithms for homomorphic encryption
-   continually improving their performance and reliability through timing optimisation and verification
-   documenting and benchmarking the implemented cryptographic operations
-   help evaluate plans for custom hardware

You will be working with us on the cutting-edge of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), designing and implementing hardware that will enable privacy by default.FHE is an exciting field in cryptography with many opportunities for filing patents, publishing papers, and presenting your work at conferences.

Preferred experience
--------------------

You should have:

-   have a PhD in cryptography, or a Master's degree in Engineering with more than four (4) years of industry experience
-   be well versed in VHDL and/or Verilog
-   have a strong knowledge of FPGA tool flows, familiarity with cutting-edge FPGA devices, and be comfortable with debugging and reaching timing closure
-   have a strong interest in cryptography and a passion for privacy
-   good analytical skills
-   good written and oral communication skills
-   experience implementing lattice-based cryptography on FPGA/ASIC is a plus
-   knowledge of computer & SoC architectures and industry-standard interfaces is a plus
-   experience with verification using SystemVerilog is a plus
-   experience with AWS FPGAs is a plus

Full remote is possible, with a willingness to come to Paris quarterly.
